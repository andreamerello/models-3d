Box for car battery charger cable
---------------------------------

NOTE: This box is an experiment using parametric feature.

A friend gifted me battery charger with a broken wire: the positive wire has a weird cable which contains the actual positive wire and some thin wires attached to a little PCB with a LED, a resistor and a thermistor.

I fixed the wire and designed di small box to contain the PCB and the wire joint.
